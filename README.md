# MathieuPerturbationMethod
A Maple worksheet checking Mathieu's original perturbation solution of the Mathieu equation.  If you do not have access to Maple, you can download the free Maple Player from https://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/Mapleplayer/

One purpose of this worksheet was to check Mathieu's work (he made a few minor errors over many, many pages of work).  The other was to understand his method, which anticipated Lindstedt in enforcing periodicity as anti-secularity.

The Maple worksheet is not heavily commented; it is more of a scratchpad.  But if read in conjunction with the final appendix of the paper <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01812">Brimacombe, Corless, & Zamir, COMPUTATION AND APPLICATIONS OF MATHIEU FUNCTIONS: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</A> (link goes to the arXiv version, the full version of which is to appear in SIAM Review) it should be straightforward.
